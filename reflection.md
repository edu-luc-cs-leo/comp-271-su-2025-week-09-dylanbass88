After looking at Leo’s solution to the hash table, I realized that my code worked okay but was missing a lot of the structure and details his had. I got the general idea of using an array of linked lists, and my add() method was kind of close, but I didn’t include stuff like the load factor, resizing, or a good toString() method to show everything clearly. His version was way more organized, with constants and methods that made the code cleaner and easier to follow. I also didn’t think about things like checking for nulls in the contains() method, which I now see is really important. Honestly, I think I waited too long to start that assignment and kind of rushed through it just to get it done. Next time, I’m going to start earlier and try to look at the examples before I write anything so I can learn how to do it right from the beginning.
